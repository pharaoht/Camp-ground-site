Restful routes
there are seven of them

INDEX      /dogs            GET     Display a list of all dogs
NEW        /dogs/new        GET     Displays a form to make a new dog
CREATE     /dogs            POST    Add new dog to DB
SHOW       /dogs/:id        GET     Shows info about one dog
EDIT       /dogs/:id/edit   GET     Show edit form for on dog
UPDATE     /dogs/:id        PUT     Update one dog, then redirect
DESTROY    /dogs/:id        DELETE  Delete one dog, then redirect







Rest is a pattern for defining our routes, its a way of mapping HTTP routes
together.
